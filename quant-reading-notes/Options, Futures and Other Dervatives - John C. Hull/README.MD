# 📘 Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives — John C. Hull  

Often referred to as the **“Quant Bible”**, this was my very first book related to the field of quantitative finance. I personally bought the **11th Global Edition (physical copy)**, and I was excited — even reassured — when I read the first sentence of the synopsis:  

> *“A go-to book not only for instructors and students.”*  

That line gave me the strength and confidence to commit to the purchase, marking the real beginning of my **quantitative journey**.

## 📝 How I Document My Learning  

In this README, I write **simple reflections** guided by a few core questions:  

- **What clicked?** → the core idea in my own words.  
- **What was tough?** → where I struggled and need to revisit.  
- **Takeaway?** → the one-liner worth remembering.  

This acts as both a way to **internalize concepts** and to **document my journey of studying quant** while pursuing my Computer Science degree at the **Singapore Institute of Technology**.  

Additionally, I attempt all the **practice questions** for the chapters. I don’t attach my attempts here — since I use them as a learning tool rather than a test of skill — which feels fair given I’m still new (“green”) to this field.

## 📖 Chapter 1: Introduction  

**1. What clicked?**  
The chapter introduced the basics: calls, puts, options, forwards, and the types of traders. I especially appreciated the snapshot on **Lehman Brothers** and their downfall during the 2008 financial crisis — it grounded the theory in a real-world event. Overall, it gave me a solid foundation in market basics.  

**2. What was tough?**  
Most of the chapter was straightforward. The one area that opened my eyes was the many combinations of long calls, short calls, long puts, and short puts. These can be structured into strategies like collars or bull spreads. It made me realize how deep the strategies go.  

**3. Takeaway**  
There are three main types of traders: **hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs** — and each uses different techniques worth studying in depth.

## 📖 Chapter 2: Futures Markets and Central Counterparties  

**1. What clicked?**  
I enjoyed learning about the differences between **forwards and futures**, and the role of **OTC intermediaries** like CCPs and exchange **clearing houses**. I found it fascinating how all traders come together in one place, with risks of defaults and collateral managed by intermediaries. I also enjoyed connecting futures concepts to actual **day-trading tools** like limit orders, stop orders, and stop-limit orders — and understanding how traders can both protect themselves and take advantage of positions.  

**2. What was tough?**  
It was challenging to fully grasp Hull’s explanations here. For example, when he introduced concepts like **open interest** or the obligations of a short futures position, it often felt very subtle in the text. While doing practice questions, I realized my answers weren’t framed the way Hull expected. This forced me to dive deeper into each question, carefully breaking down keywords and key concepts.  

**3. Takeaway**  
Futures differ from forwards mainly because of **daily settlement, standardization, and the role of clearing houses/CCPs**. These features reduce credit risk but also introduce daily cash flow considerations — making futures both more secure and more dynamic than forwards.
